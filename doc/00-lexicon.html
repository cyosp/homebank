    <h2 id="wallet">Wallet</h2>
    <p>Wallet is the 1st level of data. It represent a HomeBank file (.xhb)<br>
    Managing the few wallet properties is done in the <a href="dlg-wall.html">Properties dialog</a>.</p>
    <p class="top"><a href="#top">↑ Back to Top</a></p>
  </div>
  <div class="rounded content">
    <h2 id="account">Account</h2>
    <p>Account is the 2nd level of the data. An account is a division of the wallet, that will contains your financial transactions.<br>
    Managing the accounts is done in the <a href="dlg-acco.html">Accounts dialog</a>.</p>

  <div class="rounded content">
    <h2 id="acctype">Account type</h2>
    <p>Account type is a simple classification for account, only to group account display into the main windows 'Your accounts' area.
    As so there is no specific behavior beneath them.<br>Most of those type comes from QIF and OFX specification, the usage definition from various sources.</p>
    <h3 id="atbank">Bank</h3>
    <p>Used as a general account held by a bank or any financial institution.</p>
    <h3 id="atcash">Cash</h3>
    <p>Used to track the spending of cash you withdraw from a bank account (or credit card,
in the case of a cash advance). Whenever you take cash out of an account (e.g. an ATM
withdrawal), transfer the money to your newly created cash account. Then, whenever
you spend the cash on something, create a withdrawal in the cash account for the appropriate amount.</p>
    <h3 id="atasset">Asset</h3>
    <p>Used to track the value of property you own or money that is owed to you. For example,
if you own a vehicle, an asset account can help you track appreciation and depreciation
on that property. When using an asset account, record the base value of the asset as a
deposit into the account, then enter gains or earnings as positive transactions and losses
as negative transactions.</p>
    <h3 id="atccard">Credit card</h3>
    <p>Used to track charges and payments made against a credit account. Charges made to the account should be entered
as negative transactions; payments should be positive (either deposits or transfers from
other accounts). The balance of a credit card account should almost always be negative or zero - a positive balance would indicate a credit on the account due to over-payment.</p>
    <h3 id="atliability">Liability</h3>
    <p>Used to track debt or money owed for which you do not make regular payments. When
using a liability account, record the initial amount owed as a withdrawal from the account, 
then enter any payments made against the debt as deposits or transfers into the
account.</p>
    <h3 id="atchecking">Checking</h3>
    <p>Used to track deposits and withdrawals from a typical bank checking account.</p>
    <h3 id="atsavings">Savings</h3>
    <p>Used to track deposits and withdrawals from a typical bank savings account.</p>

    <h2 id="transaction">Transaction</h2>
    <p>Transaction is the last level of data. A transaction is a financial transaction, attached to its own account.</p>
    <p>In addition to the usual fields you can find in most accounting application, HomeBank offers the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>tags: like in the web, you can assign some tags to a transaction</li>
      <li>payment: small image showing the payment mode</li>
      <li>info: miscellaneous data for payment, like date, cheque number and so on</li>
      <li><a href="#txnremind">remind</a> state: to keep track of debt</li>
      <li>vehicle-cost data: memo field can contain data for your vehicle refuels</li>

    <h3 id="txnincome">Income</h3>
    <p>An income is an amount with a positive sign, also called a credit.</p>

    <h3 id="txntransfer">Transfer</h3>
    <p>A transfer (more precisely internal transfer) is a money movement between <u>2 of your accounts</u>, in one or several Financial institution, as so, like you emit and receive the money there is no payee.<br>
    <p>This is a special transfer for HomeBank, as it will link the source and destination transaction for further changes of most data to be synced.<br>
    In exception of the Status and Date (and Amount the opposite sign), all the fields will be synced, whatever you make some changes from src or dst account.<br>
    The reason is that the money may arrive on the dst account a few days later, and when you reconcile you will do account separately.<br>
    Since v5.7 there is a preference to sync also the status by default.</p>
    <p>When you change the type of a transaction to this one, HomeBank may propose some potential target transaction for you to select within <a href="dlg-xfer.html">this dialog</a>.</p>
    <p> <i class="warning"><img src="images/d-warn.png" alt="warning">&nbsp;transfer have some usage limitation:</i></p>

    For example, if you input '3+2*6', result will be 30 (3+2=5, 5*6=30), and not 15 like it would be in a calculator.</p>

    Every-time you save your file, the previous version will be saved with .xhb~ (tilde at the end), into the wallet folder.<br>
    To get back to this file, you can use the File > Revert menu. If there is no .xhb~ file, this menu will be disabled.</p>
    <p><b>2) the backup file once a day</b><br>
    Each day you save your file for the first time, a .bak file will be created into the backup folder. Which means if you save it 3 times during the same day, only the first save will be saved as the day backup.<br>
    To get back to one of this backup, you can use the File > Restore backup menu. If there is no .bak file, this menu will be disabled.</p>

    <p>With this mechanism, you have a good compromise between safety backup and data storage.</p>
